Changes in version 0.99.5 (2019-05-01)
+ Major change: Use HDF5 file to write and read the matrix by chunks
+ Major change: load the intermediate datasets from AnnotationHub

Changes in version 0.99.4 (2019-04-05)
+ Using BiocCache to cache the intermediate datasets as a temporary solution
  before signatureSearchData package is released.
+ The cmap/lincs databases are stored in AnnotationHub from data package
  o The LINCS databases were created by reading the large matrix into memory
    from gctx file, and saving it as HDF5 backed SE object. 
    It requires large number of memory (50Gb), needs to be addressed to be 
    memory efficient.
 + Almost finish the documentation

Changes in version 0.99.3 (2019-03-15)
+ Store intermediate datasets (like DO_DATA.rds) at inst/extdata to avoid
  downloading from biocluster to system.file(package="signatureSearch")
+ Temporary solution for testing

Changes in version 0.99.2 (2019-03-15)
+ Download intermediate datasets (like DO_DATA.rds) from biocluster to 
  system.file(package="signatureSearch"), which makes errors when user do not
  have right to write the system.file
