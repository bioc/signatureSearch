\title{Environment for Gene Expression Signature Searching Combined with 
Functional Enrichment Analysis}
\description{
Welcome to the signatureSearch package! This package implements algorithms 
and data structures for performing gene expression signature (GES) searches, 
and subsequently interpreting the results functionally with specialized 
enrichment methods. These utilities are useful for studying the effects of 
genetic, chemical and environmental perturbations on biological systems. 
Specifically, in drug discovery they can be used for identifying novel modes 
of action (MOA) of bioactive compounds from reference databases such as 
LINCS containing the genome-wide GESs from tens of thousands of drug and 
genetic perturbations (Subramanian et al. 2017)

A typical GES search (GESS) workflow can be divided into two major steps.
First, GESS methods are used to identify perturbagens such as drugs that 
induce GESs similar to a query GES of interest. The queries can be drug-, 
disease- or phenotype-related GESs. Since the MOAs of most drugs in the 
corresponding reference databases are known, the resulting associations are 
useful to gain insights into pharmacological and/or disease mechanisms, and 
to develop novel drug repurposing approaches.

Second, specialized functional enrichment analysis (FEA) methods using 
annotations systems, such as Gene Ontologies (GO), pathways or Disease 
Ontologies (DO), have been developed and implemented in this package to 
efficiently interpret GESS results. The latter are usually composed of lists 
of perturbagens (e.g. drugs) ranked by the similarity metric of the 
corresponding GESS method.

Finally, network resconstruction functionalities are integrated for 
visualizing the final results, e.g. in form of drug-target networks.
}
\details{
The GESS methods include \code{CMAP}, \code{LINCS}, \code{gCMAP}, 
\code{Fisher} and \code{Cor}. For detailed
description, please see help files of each method. Most methods 
can be easily paralleled for multiple query signatures.

GESS results are lists of perturbagens (here drugs) ranked by their 
signature similarity to a query signature of interest. Interpreting these 
search results with respect to the cellular networks and pathways affected 
by the top ranking drugs is difficult. To overcome this challenge, the 
knowledge of the target proteins of the top ranking drugs can be used to 
perform functional enrichment analysis (FEA) based on community annotation 
systems, such as Gene Ontologies (GO), pathways (e.g. KEGG, Reactome), drug 
MOAs or Pfam domains. For this, the ranked drug sets are converted into 
target gene/protein sets to perform Target Set Enrichment Analysis (TSEA) 
based on a chosen annotation system. Alternatively, the functional 
annotation categories of the targets can be assigned to the drugs directly 
to perform Drug Set Enrichment Analysis (DSEA). Although TSEA and DSEA are 
related, their enrichment results can be distinct. This is mainly due to 
duplicated targets present in the test sets of the TSEA methods, whereas 
the drugs in the test sets of DSEA are usually unique. Additional reasons 
include differences in the universe sizes used for TSEA and DSEA.

Importantly, the duplications in the test sets of the TSEA are due to the 
fact that many drugs share the same target proteins. Standard enrichment 
methods would eliminate these duplications since they assume uniqueness 
in the test sets. Removing duplications in TSEA would be inappropriate 
since it would erase one of the most important pieces of information of 
this approach. To solve this problem, we have developed and implemented in 
this package weighting methods (\code{dup_hyperG}, \code{mGSEA} and 
\code{meanAbs}) for duplicated targets, where the weighting 
is proportional to the frequency of the targets in the test set.

Instead of translating ranked lists of drugs into target sets, as for TSEA, 
the functional annotation categories of the targets can be assigned to the 
drugs directly to perform DSEA instead. Since the drug lists from GESS 
results are usually unique, this strategy overcomes the duplication problem 
of the TSEA approach. This way classical enrichment methods, such as GSEA or 
tests based on the hypergeometric distribution, can be readily applied 
without major modifications to the underlying statistical methods. As 
explained above, TSEA and DSEA performed with the same enrichment statistics 
are not expected to generate identical results. Rather they often complement 
each other's strengths and weaknesses.

To perform TSEA and DSEA, drug-target annotations are essential. They can be
obtained from several sources, including DrugBank, ChEMBL, STITCH, and the 
Touchstone dataset from the LINCS project (https://clue.io/). Most 
drug-target annotations provide UniProt identifiers for the target proteins. 
They can be mapped, if necessary via their encoding genes, to the chosen 
functional annotation categories, such as GO or KEGG. To minimize bias in 
TSEA or DSEA, often caused by promiscuous binders, it can be beneficial to 
remove drugs or targets that bind to large numbers of distinct proteins or 
drugs, respectively.

Note, most FEA tests involving proteins in their test sets are performed on 
the gene level in \code{signatureSearch}. This way one can avoid additional 
duplications due to many-to-one relationships among proteins and their 
encoding gents. For this, the corresponding functions in signatureSearch 
will usually translate target protein sets into their encoding gene sets 
using identifier mapping resources from R/Bioconductor such as the 
\code{org.Hs.eg.db} annotation package. Because of this as well as 
simplicity, the text in the vignette and help files of this package will 
refer to the targets of drugs almost interchangeably to proteins or genes, 
even though the former are the direct targets and the latter only the 
indirect targets of drugs.

\section{Terminology}{

The term Gene Expression Signatures (GESs) can refer to at least four 
different situations of pre-processed gene expression data: (1) normalized 
gene expression intensity values (or counts for RNA-Seq); (2) log2 fold 
changes (LFC), z-scores or p-values obtained from analysis routines of 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs); (3) rank transformed versions of the 
expression values obtained under (1) and (2); and (4) gene identifier sets 
extracted from the top and lowest ranks under (3), such as n top up/down 
regulated DEGs.
