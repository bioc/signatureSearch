\title{gCMAP Search Method}
\usage{
gess_gcmap(qSig, higher, lower, chunk_size = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{qSig}{\code{\link{qSig}} object defining the query signature, the GESS
method (should be 'gCMAP') and the path to the reference database.}

\item{higher}{The 'higher' threshold. If not 'NULL', genes with a score 
larger than 'higher' will be included in the gene set with sign +1. 
At least one of 'lower' and 'higher' must be specified.}

\item{lower}{The lower threshold. If not 'NULL', genes with a score smaller 
than 'lower' will be included in the gene set with sign -1. 
At least one of 'lower' and 'higher' must be specified.}

\item{chunk_size}{size of chunk per processing}
}
\value{
\code{\link{gessResult}} object, the result table contains the 
search results for each perturbagen in the reference database ranked by 
their signature similarity to the query.
}
\description{
It uses query signature to search against the reference database defined in 
the \code{\link{qSig}} object by gCMAP method, which is adapted from the 
gCMAP package (Sandmann et al., 2014)
}
\details{
The Bioconductor gCMAP (Sandmann et al. 2014) package provides access to a 
related but not identical implementation of the original CMAP algorithm 
proposed by Lamb et al. (2006). It uses as query a rank transformed GES and 
the reference database is composed of the labels of up and down regulated 
DEG sets. This is the opposite situation of the CMAP method, where the query 
is composed of the labels of up and down regulated DEGs and the database 
contains rank transformed GESs.
}
\section{Column description}{

Description of the score columns in the result table specific for gCMAP 
method:
\itemize{
    \item effect: Scaled bi-directional enrichment score corresponding to 
    the scaled_score under the CMAP result.
    \item nSet: Number of genes in the reference gene sets after applying
    the higher and lower cutoff.
    \item nFound: Number of genes in the reference gene sets that are 
    present in the query signature.
    \item signed: Whether the gene sets in the reference database have signs, 
    e.g. representing up and down regulated genes when computing scores.
}
Description of the other columns are available at the 'result' slot of the
\code{\link{gessResult}} object.
