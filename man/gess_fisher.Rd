\title{Fisher method for GESS}
\usage{
gess_fisher(qSig, higher, lower, chunk_size = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{qSig}{`qSig` object, 
The 'gess_method' slot of 'qSig' should be 'Fisher'}

\item{higher}{The 'higher' threshold. If not 'NULL', genes with a score 
larger than 'higher' will be included in the gene set with sign +1. 
At least one of 'lower' and 'higher' must be specified.}

\item{lower}{The lower threshold. If not 'NULL', genes with a score smaller 
than 'lower' will be included in the gene set with sign -1. 
At least one of 'lower' and 'higher' must be specified.}

\item{chunk_size}{size of chunk per processing}
}
\value{
gessResult object, containing drugs in the reference database
ranked by their similarity to the query signature
}
\description{
It uses query signature to search against the reference database in the 
\code{qSig} by Fisher's exact test
}
\details{
The Fisherâ€™s exact test can also be used as similarity search algorithm if 
both the query and the database are composed of DEG sets.
}
\examples{
db_dir <- system.file("extdata", "sample_db", package = "signatureSearch")
sample_db <- loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment(db_dir)
## get "vorinostat__SKB__trt_cp" signature drawn from sample databass
query_mat <- as.matrix(assay(sample_db[,"vorinostat__SKB__trt_cp"]))
qsig_fisher <- qSig(qsig=query_mat, gess_method="Fisher", refdb=sample_db)
fisher <- gess_fisher(qSig=qsig_fisher, higher=1, lower=-1)
result(fisher)
