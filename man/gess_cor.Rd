\title{Correlation based method for GESS}
\usage{
gess_cor(qSig, method, chunk_size = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{qSig}{`qSig` object, The 'gess_method' slot should be 'Cor'. 
The reference database in the \code{qsig} could either store gene expression 
values or differential expression scores.}

\item{method}{One of 'spearman' (default), 'kendall', or 'pearson',
indicating which correlation coefficient to be used.}

\item{chunk_size}{size of chunk per processing}
}
\value{
gessResult object, containing drugs in the reference database
ranked by their similarity to the query signature
}
\description{
It uses query signature to search against the reference database in the 
\code{\link{qSig}} object by measuring correlation coefficient.
}
\details{
The correlation coefficients can be used as a GESS method by searching 
with a query expression profile a database of expression profiles. 
Correlation-based queries were performed with genome-wide GEPs as well as 
with GEPs subset to the same query genes used for the set enrichment 
methods (\code{CMAP}, \code{LINCS} and \code{Fisher}). 
The latter situation makes the correlation-based results more comparable 
to the set enrichment methods by providing to each method a more equal 
amount of information than this is the case for the correlation method with 
genome-wide GEPs. 

Description of the score columns in the gess_cor tibble result:
\itemize{
    \item cor_score: Correlation coefficient based on the method defined in 
    the gess_cor function.
}
