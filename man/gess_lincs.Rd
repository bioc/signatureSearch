\title{LINCS method for GESS}
\usage{
gess_lincs(qSig, ES_NULL = "Default", tau = FALSE, sortby = "NCS",
  chunk_size = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{qSig}{`qSig` object, The 'gess_method' slot should be 'LINCS'}

\item{ES_NULL}{can be set as `Default`, representing the null distribution 
of WTCS. The null distribution is generated with random queries for 
computing nominal P-values for WTCS. If set as `Default`, it uses the 
null distribution that we generated by running 1000 random queries 
against LINCS database.

It can also be a character representing path to the ES_NULL file generated
from `randQueryES` function. 
But it might take 3 days running 1000 random queries against LINCS
database locally without parallelizing jobs. 
To save time, it is recommended to parallelize with BiocParallel 
to run on CPU cores of a computer cluster with a scheduler (e.g. Slurm). For
vignette of generating the ES null distribution with Slurm scheduler on a 
computer cluster, please refer to the vignette in `signatureSearch_data` 
package by running `browseVignettes("signatureSearch_data")` in R.}

\item{tau}{TRUE or FALSE, whether to compute the tau score. It is only 
meaningful when the "refdb" in "qSig" is LINCS since the reference
queries are from LINCS database.}

\item{sortby}{rank the GESS result by one of the following scores: 
`WTCS`, `NCS`, `Tau`, `NCSct` or `NA`}

\item{chunk_size}{size of chunk per processing}
}
\value{
\code{\link{gessResult}} object, containing drugs in the reference 
database ranked by their similarity to the query signature
}
\description{
It uses query signature to search against the reference database in the 
\code{qSig} by LINCS method, which is an implementation of the method from 
Subramanian et al, 2017.
}
\details{
Subramanian et al., 2017 introduced a new GESS method (\code{LINCS}) that is 
similar with the CMAP method but weights genes in the query set by using 
expression profiles with scores instead of rank transformed as reference 
database. Since now, no implementations of this algorithm available, it is 
implemented here. 

The LINCS method takes about 1.7 min on a single CPU core for querying 
with a single signature against 10,000 signatures in the LINCS database.

Description of the score columns in the gess_lincs tibble result:
\itemize{
  \item WTCS: Weighted Connectivity Score, a bi-directional Enrichment 
  Score of up and down query set. If ES of up and down sets are of different
  signs, WTCS is (ESup-ESdown)/2, otherwise, it is 0. WTCS ranges between 
  âˆ’1 and 1. It will be positive for signatures that are positively related 
  and negative for those that are inversely related, and near zero for 
  signatures that are unrelated.
  \item WTCS_Pval: Nominal p-value of WTCS computed by comparing WTCS 
  against WTCS null distribution obtained from random queries
  \item WTCS_FDR: false discovery rate of WTCS P value
  \item NCS: To make connectivity scores comparable across cell types and 
  perturbation types, the scores are normalized. Given a vector of WTCS 
  values w resulting from a query, the values are normalized within each 
  cell line c and perturbagen type t to obtain Normalized Connectivity Scores
   (NCS) by dividing the WTCS score with signed mean of WTCS scores within 
  the subset of signatures in reference database corresponding to c and t.
  \item Tau: Tau score compares observed NCS to all others in Qref (All 
  query signatures in reference database). It represents the percentage of 
  reference queries with a lower |NCS| than |NCSq,r|, adjusted to retain 
  the sign of NCSq,r. NCSq,r is the normalized connectivity score for 
  signature r relative to query q. A tau of 90 indicates that only 10 
  percent of reference perturbations showed stronger connectivity to the 
  query. 
  \item TauRefSize: Size of reference perturbations for computing Tau.
  \item NCSct: Summarized NCS across cell types. Given a vector of NCS
  for perturbagen p, relative to query q, across all cell lines c in which p 
  was profiled, a cell-summarized connectivity score is obtained using a 
  maximum quantile statistic. It compares the 67 and 33 quantiles of 
  NCSp,c and retains whichever is of higher absolute magnitude.
