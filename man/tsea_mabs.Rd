\usage{
tsea_mabs(drugs, type = "GO", ont = "MF", nPerm = 1000,
  pAdjustMethod = "BH", pvalueCutoff = 0.05, minGSSize = 5,
  maxGSSize = 500, dt_anno = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{drugs}{character vector, query drug set used for functional enrichment.
Can be top ranking drugs in the GESS result.}

\item{type}{one of `GO` or `KEGG`}

\item{ont}{character(1). If type is `GO`, set ontology as one of `BP`,`MF`,
`CC` or `ALL`. If type is 'KEGG', it is ignored.}

\item{nPerm}{integer, permutation numbers used to calculate p-value}

\item{pAdjustMethod}{p-value adjustment method, 
one of 'holm', 'hochberg', 'hommel', 'bonferroni', 'BH', 'BY', 'fdr'}

\item{pvalueCutoff}{double, p-value cutoff}

\item{minGSSize}{integer, minimum size of each gene set in annotation system}

\item{maxGSSize}{integer, maximum size of each gene set in annotation system}

\item{dt_anno}{drug-target annotation resource. one of 'DrugBank', 'CLUE', 
'STITCH' or 'all'. If 'dt_anno' is 'all', the targets from DrugBank, CLUE 
and STITCH databases will be combined. It is recommended to set the 'dt_anno'
as 'all' since it will get the most complete target set of as many drugs
as possible. Users could also choose individual annotation resource if 
wanted, but should be aware that if the chosen drug-target annotation
resource contains limited drugs (such as CLUE), many query drugs will not
get targets and the target set may not be complete, which could affect
the enrichment result.}

\value{
\code{\link{feaResult}} object, the result table contains the
enriched functional categories (e.g. GO terms or KEGG pathways) ranked by 
the corresponding enrichment statistic.

\description{
The meanAbs (mabs) method supports target set with duplications by 
transforming it to a score ranked target list and calculating mean absolute 
scores of genes sin gene set \emph{S}
}
\details{
The input for the \emph{mabs} method is \emph{L_tar}, the same as for 
\code{mGSEA}. In this enrichment statistic, \emph{mabs(S)}, of a gene set 
\emph{S} is calculated as mean absolute scores of the genes in \emph{S}. 
In order to adjust for size variations in gene set \emph{S}, 1000 random 
permutations of \emph{L_tar} are performed to determine \emph{mabs(S,pi)}. 
Subsequently, \emph{mabs(S)} is normalized by subtracting the median of the 
\emph{mabs(S,pi)} and then dividing by the standard deviation of 
\emph{mabs(S,pi)} yielding the normalized scores \emph{Nmabs(S)}. Finally, 
the portion of \emph{mabs(S,pi)} that is greater than \emph{mabs(S)} is 
used as nominal p-value (Fang et al., 2012). 
The resulting nominal p-values are adjusted for 
multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

\section{Column description}{

Description of the columns in the result table specific to the MeanAbs 
algorithm:
\itemize{
    \item mabs: Given a scored ranked gene list L, mabs(S) represents
    the mean absolute scores of the genes in set S. 
    \item Nmabs: mabs(S) normalized
}
Description of the other columns are available at the 'result' slot of the
\code{\link{feaResult}} object.
