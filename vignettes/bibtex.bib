  abstract = "Disease incidences increase with age, but the molecular
              characteristics of ageing that lead to increased disease
              susceptibility remain inadequately understood. Here we perform a
              whole-blood gene expression meta-analysis in 14,983 individuals
              of European ancestry (including replication) and identify 1,497
              genes that are differentially expressed with chronological age.
              The age-associated genes do not harbor more age-associated
              CpG-methylation sites than other genes, but are instead enriched
              for the presence of potentially functional CpG-methylation sites
              in enhancer and insulator regions that associate with both
              chronological age and gene expression levels. We further used the
              gene expression profiles to calculate the 'transcriptomic age' of
              an individual, and show that differences between transcriptomic
              age and chronological age are associated with biological features
              linked to ageing, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels,
              fasting glucose, and body mass index. The transcriptomic
              prediction model adds biological relevance and complements
              existing epigenetic prediction models, and can be used by others
              to calculate transcriptomic age in external cohorts.",

              tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from

              powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

              regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several
              cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer.
              Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity
              between two independent studies of patient survival in lung
              cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA
