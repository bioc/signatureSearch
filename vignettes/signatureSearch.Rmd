# Background

This project is about optimizing signature search and enrichment methods for 
the discovery of novel modes of action (MOA) of bioactive compounds from 
reference databases, such as LINCS, containing the genome-wide gene expression 
signatures (GESs) from tens of thousands of drug and genetic perturbations. 
The methods can be divided into two major classes. First, gene expression 
signature search (GESS) methods are used to identify drugs that induce GESs 
similar to those of query GESs of interest. The queries can be drug- or 
disease-related GESs. Since the MOA of most drugs in the corresponding 
reference databases are known, the resulting associations are useful to gain 
insights into pharmacological and disease mechanisms and to develop novel drug 
repurposing approaches. Second, functional enrichment analysis (FEA) methods 
using Gene Ontology (GO) or pathway annotations have been developed to 
functionally interpret the vast number of GESS results. The latter are 
composed of lists of drugs ranked by the similarity metric of the corresponding 
GESS method making the functional interpretation of their top ranking drugs 
challenging. Importantly, the FEA methods developed by this study also support 
the reconstruction of drug-target networks to guide the interpretation of the 
results.

@Lamb2006-du generated a GES database, initially including 164 drugs screened 
against four mammalian cell lines [@Lamb2006-du]. A few years later it was 
extended to 1,309 drugs and eight cell lines. In 2017, the database was 
increased to 19,811 drugs by the Library of Network-Based Cellular Signatures 
(LINCS) Consortium [@Subramanian2017-fu], while the number of cell types 
represented in the database has increased to over 70 normal and cancer cell 
lines. The number of compound dosages and time points considered in the assays 
has also been increased by 10-20 fold. The initial database used Affymetrix 
Gene Chips as expression platform. To scale from a few thousand to many hundred 
thousand GESs, the LINCS Consortium uses now the more economic L1000 assay. 
This bead-based technology is a low cost, high-throughput reduced 
representation expression profiling assay. It measures the expression of 978 
landmark genes and 80 control genes by detecting fluorescent intensity of beads 
after capturing the ligation-mediated amplification products of mRNAs 
[@Peck2006-rf]. The expression of 11,350 additional genes is imputed from the 
landmark genes by using as training data a collection of 12,063 Affymetrix gene 
chips [@Edgar2002-di]. The substantial scale-up of the LINCS project provides 
now many new opportunities to explore MOAs for a vast number of small molecules.
Figure 1 illustrates the entire GESS/FEA workflow.

Figure 1: Overview of GESS and FEA methods. GES queries are used to search a 
drug-based GES reference database for drugs inducing GESs similar to the query. 
To interpret the results mechanistically, the GESS results are subjected to 
functional enrichment analysis (FEA) including drug and target enrichment 
analyses (DSEA, TSEA). Both identify enriched functional categories (GO terms 
and/or KEGG pathways) in the GESS results. Subsequently, drug-target networks 
are reconstructed for visualization and interpretation.

# Terminology

Gene Expression Signatures (GESs): can be gene expression profiles (GEPs), 
which can be genome-wide profile from differential expression analysis ($log_2$ 
ratios or z-scores) or gene expression intensity values from perturbagen 
treatment in cell culture, or differentially expressed gene sets (DEGs) from 
a treatment.

# Reference Database

The CMAP and LINCS signature databases were stored in HDF5 files and available
at `signatureSearchData` package where the data were stored at `AnnotationHub`. 
User can download the CMAP/LINCS databases we generated 
as follows, it returns to the file path to the downloaded databases:
```{r download_db, eval=FALSE}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
cmap <- ah[["AH69075"]]; cmap_expr <- ah[["AH69077"]]
lincs <- ah[["AH69079"]]; lincs_expr <- ah[["AH69081"]]
```

The loaded `lincs` database represents moderated z-scores from differential 
expression (DE) analysis of 12,328 genes from 8,140 compound treatments in 
30 cells (45,956 signatures in total). The `lincs_expr` 
database contains gene expression intensity values from 5,925 compound
treatments in 30 cells (38,824 signatures in total). 

The loaded `cmap` database represents the $log_2$ fold change of 12,437 genes 
from 1,281 compound treatments in 5 cells (3,478 signatures in total).
The `cmap_expr` database represents mean expression values of 1,309 drug
treatment samples in 4 cells (3,587 signatures in total).

For documentations of generating the CMAP/LINCS databases, please refer to the 
vignette of `signatureSearchData` package by running 
`browseVignettes("signatureSearchData")` in R.

The custom database can be built via `build_custom_db` function if a 
`data.frame` or `matrix` representing genome-wide GEPs of compound or genetic 
treatments in cells is provided. The GEPs can be log2 fold change, 
z-scores *etc.* from differential expression analysis, or gene expression 
intensity values from Affymetrix Chips, or read counts from RNA-Seq data.

# Implementation of *signatureSearch* package

It is necessary to integrate the GESS and FEA methods into an R/Bioconductor 
package since it enables efficient testing across large and extendable number 
of statistical methods and expression data types, simplifies development of 
automated analysis workflows, the usage of generic data objects and classes 
improves maintainability and reproducibility, the integration with existing 
R/Bioconductor ecosystem maximizes extensibility and reusability by other 
groups. Figure 2 shows the workflow design of the package. The expression 
profiles from RNA-Seq, Affymetrix chips or other technology can be used to 
build the reference database and stored in HDF5 files. 
The query signature and reference database were built into *qSig* 
object and 5 methods are supported for searching. Since the reference database 
could contain hundreds of thousands of signatures, the searching process
was volumized for efficient memory usage and faster time performance. 
The search results are stored in *gessResult* object and can be functionally 
annotated by TSEA and DSEA methods. The enrichment results are stored in 
*feaResult* object and the drug target networks can be built for visualization.

RNA-Seq, Affymetrix chips or other technology can be used to build the 
custom reference database and stored in an HDF5 file. The database can also be
HDF5 files representing CMAP/LINCS databases available at _signatureSearchData_
package. The query signature and reference database are built into a *qSig* 
object and 5 GESS methods (CMAP, LINCS, gCMAP, Fisher, and Spearman correlation)
are supported for searching. 
The search results are stored in a *gessResult* object and can be 
functionally annotated by TSEA (dup_hyperG, mGSEA, mabs) and DSEA (hyperG, GSEA)
methods. The enrichment results are stored in a *feaResult* object and the 
drug target networks can be built for visualization. Cont: container.

`BiocManager::install()`
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("signatureSearch", version = "3.9")
```

After the package is installed, it can be loaded into *R* workspace by
```{r load, eval=TRUE}
library(signatureSearch)
```

# Methods for GESS

As an example of running GESS/FEA workflow, 95 GEPs randomly sampled from 
`lincs` database and 5 GEPs from `HDAC inhibitors` (`vorinostat`, `rhamnetin`, 
`trichostatin A`, `pyroxamide`, and `HC toxin`) in human SKB (muscle)
cell were combined to generate a sample reference database. The query signature 
is the vorinostat treatment drawn from the sample database.

## Load database and get query signature
```{r db_sig, eval=TRUE}
db_path <- system.file("extdata", "sample_db.h5", package = "signatureSearch")
# Load sample_db as `SummarizedExperiment` object
library(signatureSearchData)
sample_db <- readHDF5chunk(db_path, colindex=1:100)
# get "vorinostat__SKB__trt_cp" signature drawn from sample database
query_mat <- as.matrix(assay(sample_db[,"vorinostat__SKB__trt_cp"]))
query = as.numeric(query_mat); names(query) = rownames(query_mat)
upset <- head(names(query[order(-query)]), 150)
downset <- tail(names(query[order(-query)]), 150)
```

## Search with CMAP method for GESS

@Lamb2006-du introduced the gene expression-based search method known as 
Connectivity Map (CMap) where a GES database is searched with a query GES for 
similar matches [@Lamb2006-du]. Here, we generalize this type of GES similarity 
search method and refer to it as GES search (GESS). Specifically, the GESS 
method from @Lamb2006-du, termed as *CMAP*, uses as query the most up- 
and down-regulated DEGs from a genome-wide expression experiment. The GES query 
is used to search a database of rank transformed GEPs and ranks the results by 
the degree of enrichment of the up- and down-regulated query genes on the top 
and bottom of the databases entries, respectively. The search results are a 
list of drugs that have similar or opposing GESs as the query. Similar GESs 
suggest similar physiological effects of the corresponding perturbagens. 
These GES associations can be useful to uncover novel treatments for a variety 
of diseases or connections among small molecules sharing a common MOA. 

Since no correct implementations of the CMAP algorithm are available for 
download, it is implemented in this package.

Generate `qSig` object for `gess_cmap` method and search against the sample
reference database
```{r gess_cmap, eval=TRUE}
qsig_cmap <- qSig(query = list(upset=upset, downset=downset), 
                  gess_method="CMAP", refdb=db_path)
cmap <- gess_cmap(qSig=qsig_cmap, chunk_size=5000)
cmap
result(cmap)
```

## Search with LINCS method for GESS

@Subramanian2017-fu introduced a new GESS method (*LINCS*) that is similar
with CMAP method but weights genes in the query set by using expression 
profiles with scores instead of rank transformed as reference database. Since
now, no implementations of this algorithm available, it is implemented
here.

Generate `qSig` object for `gess_lincs` method and search against the sample 
database
```{r gess_lincs, eval=TRUE}
qsig_lincs <- qSig(query = list(upset=upset, downset=downset), 
                   gess_method="LINCS", refdb=db_path)
lincs <- gess_lincs(qsig_lincs, sortby="NCS", tau=FALSE)
result(lincs)
```

## Search with gCMAP method for GESS

The *gCMAP* [@Sandmann2014-qm] package provides access to related but not 
identical implementations of the original CMAP algorithm proposed by 
@Lamb2006-du. It uses as query a rank transformed GEP and the reference 
database is composed of DEG sets. This is the opposite situation of the 
original *CMAP* method, where the query is a DEG set and the database 
contains rank transformed GEPs.

Generate `qSig` object for `gess_gcmap` method and search against 
the sample database
```{r gess_gcmap, eval=TRUE}
qsig_gcmap <- qSig(query = query_mat, gess_method = "gCMAP", refdb = db_path)
gcmap <- gess_gcmap(qsig_gcmap, higher=1, lower=-1)
result(gcmap)
```

## Search with Fisher method for GESS

The Fisher’s exact test [@Graham_J_G_Upton1992-pg] can also be used as search 
algorithm for querying GES databases for similar entries. This can be achieved 
if both the query and the database are composed of DEG sets.

Generate `qSig` object for `gess_fisher` method and search against the
sample database
```{r gess_fisher, eval=TRUE}
qsig_fisher <- qSig(query = query_mat, gess_method = "Fisher", refdb = db_path)
fisher <- gess_fisher(qSig=qsig_fisher, higher=1, lower=-1)
result(fisher)
```

## Search with correlation based method for GESS

The correlation coefficients can be used as a GESS method by searching
with a query expression profile a database of expression profiles.
Correlation-based queries were performed with genome-wide GEPs as well as
with GEPs subset to the same query genes used for the set enrichment
methods (*CMAP*, *LINCS* and *Fisher*).
The latter situation makes the correlation-based results more comparable
to the set enrichment methods by providing to each method a more equal
amount of information than this is the case for the correlation method with
genome-wide GEPs. Here, we choose to use Spearman correlation

Generate `qSig` object for `gess_cor` method and search against the 
sample database

### Genome-wide Spearman correlation
```{r gess_sp, eval=TRUE}
qsig_sp <- qSig(query = query_mat, gess_method = "Cor", refdb = db_path)
sp <- gess_cor(qSig=qsig_sp, method="spearman")
result(sp)
```

### Spearman subset correlation
```{r gess_spsub, eval=TRUE}
# Subset z-scores of 150 up and down gene sets from 
# "vorinostat__SKB__trt_cp" signature.
query_mat_sub <- as.matrix(query_mat[c(upset, downset),])
qsig_spsub <- qSig(query = query_mat_sub, gess_method = "Cor", refdb = db_path)
spsub <- gess_cor(qSig=qsig_spsub, method="spearman")
result(spsub)
```

## GESS result visulization

If the signature database contains drug treatments in different cell types, 
including normal and tumor, the GESS result can be visualized by summarizing 
rankings/scores of selected drugs across difference cells. The sample databases 
used in this vignette only contains treatments in SKB cell, so there is no need 
to summarize the result. I used the same `vorinostat` query signature to search 
against the full LINCS database via `gess_lincs` method, then use `gess_res_vis`
function to visualize the GESS result, Figure 3 shows the plot.

![](images/vorinostat_SKB_lincs_gess_res_vis.png)

Figure 3: Summary of NCS scores across cell types of selected drugs in 
vorinostat GESS result searching against LINCS database. Drugs 1 to 10 from 
left to right: top 10 drugs in the above lincs result searching against the 
sample database. The other drugs are HDAC inhibitors not selected in the 
sample database.

## Conclusion

4/5 HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat, trichostatin-a, HC-toxin, pyroxamide) were 
found by CMAP, LINCS, Fisher and Spearman correlation methods in their top 10 
results, demonstrating their ability to cluster drugs in the same MOA category. 
Specifically, LINCS and Spearman correlation (both genome-wide and sub) methods 
could discover another HDAC inhibitor (APHA-compound-8) in the database, which 
is promising as a discovery tool.

# FEA

GESS results are a list of drugs ranked by their signature similarity to a 
query signature of interest. Prioritizing drugs based on these rankings alone 
is challenging. To overcome this challenge, this project developed downstream 
functional enrichment analysis (FEA) methods that automate the functional 
interpretation and visualization of the GESS results. As of now, no methods 
have been developed to address this need. FEA can be performed by two 
approaches, target set enrichment analysis (TSEA) and drug set enrichment 
analysis (DSEA). Here, the GESS result from LINCS method is chosen as input for 
the downstream functional enrichment analysis.

## TSEA
GO terms and KEGG pathway annotations were used to functionally annotate GESS 
results. For this drug-target mapping information is required to link drugs 
via their targets proteins to GO terms and KEGG pathways. The TSEA approach 
uses the target proteins for the top connected drugs in the GESS results and 
then applies one of three functional enrichment methods: *dup\_hyperG*, 
*m\_GSEA* and *mabs*. The drug-target annotations required for this 
approach were obtained from DrugBank [@Wishart2018-ap], 
[Touchstone](https://clue.io/) and STITCH [@Kuhn2010-hz]. 
The STITCH database provides 
confidence scores for each drug-target interaction. Only interactions 
with confidence scores $\ge$ 0.7
were considered reliable and used for this approach. To minimize noise, 
*e.g.* from promiscuous binders, drugs with more than 100 distinct 
targets were removed. Similarly, targets with more than 100 annotated drugs 
were excluded. The remaining drug-target space considered by this study 
included 5,729 target proteins and 22,647 small molecules.

It is important to note here that the target protein sets used for the TSEA 
method contain often duplicated proteins. This is due to the fact that many 
drugs share the same target proteins. Standard enrichment methods would 
eliminate these duplications since they assume uniqueness in the test sets. 
Removing duplications in TSEA would be inappropriate since it would erase one 
of the most important pieces of information. To solve this problem, this 
project developed a weighting method for duplicated targets where the weighting 
is proportional to the frequency of the targets in the test set. 

### dup_hyperG method for TSEA

The classical hypergeometric test assumes uniqueness in its gene/protein 
test sets. Its p value is calculated according to equation

\begin{equation}
   p=\sum_{k=x}^{n} \frac {{D \choose k}{{N-D} \choose {n-k}}}{{N \choose n}}
\end{equation}

In case of GO term enrichment analysis the individual variables are assigned 
the following components.
$N$ is the total number of genes/proteins contained in the entire annotation 
(universe); $D$ is the number of genes annotated at a specific GO node; $n$ is 
the total number of genes in the test set; and $x$ is the number of genes in 
the test set annotated at a specific GO node.

To maintain the duplication information in the test sets used for TSEA, the 
values of $n$ and $x$ in the above equation are adjusted by the 
frequency of the target proteins in the test set. Effectively, the approach 
removes the duplications, but maintains their frequency information in form of 
weighting values.

Subset top 10 ranking drugs in GESS result, get their target set 
(with duplications) as query for dup_hyperG method for TSEA.
```{r tsea_dup_hyperG, eval=TRUE}
drugs <- unique(result(lincs)$pert[1:10])
# GO annotation system
dup_hyperG_res <- tsea_dup_hyperG(drugs = drugs, universe = "Default", 
                                  type = "GO", ont="MF", pvalueCutoff=0.05, 
                                  pAdjustMethod="BH", qvalueCutoff = 0.1, 
                                  minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500)
dup_hyperG_res
result(dup_hyperG_res)
# KEGG annotation system
dup_hyperG_k_res <- tsea_dup_hyperG(drugs = drugs, universe = "Default", 
                                    type = "KEGG", pvalueCutoff=0.1, 
                                    pAdjustMethod="BH", qvalueCutoff = 0.2, 
                                    minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500)
dup_hyperG_k_res
result(dup_hyperG_k_res)
```

### mGSEA method for TSEA

The original GSEA method proposed by @Subramanian2005-ro uses predefined 
gene sets $S$ given by the GO or KEGG annotations. The goal is to determine 
whether the genes in $S$ are randomly distributed throughout a ranked test 
gene list $L$ (*e.g.* all genes ranked by $log_2$ fold changes) or 
enriched at the top or bottom. This is expressed by an Enrichment Score ($ES$) 
reflecting the degree to which a set $S$ is overrepresented at the extremes 
of $L$. 

For TSEA, the query is a target set where duplicated entries are maintained. 
To perform GSEA, this target set with duplications was transformed to a scored 
ranked target list $L_{tar}$ of all targets provided by the corresponding 
annotation system. For each target in the query target set, its frequency is 
divided by the number of targets in the target set, which is the weight of that 
target. For targets present in the annotation system but absent in the target 
set, their scores are set to 0. Thus, every target in the annotation system 
will be assigned a score and then sorted decreasingly to obtain $L_{tar}$.

In case of TSEA, the original GSEA method cannot be used directly since a large 
portion of zeros exists in $L_{tar}$. If the scores of the genes in set $S$ are 
all zeros, $N_R$ (sum of scores of genes in set $S$) will be zero, which cannot 
be used as the denominator. In this case, $ES$ is set to -1. If only some genes 
in set $S$ have scores of zeros then $N_R$ is set to a larger number to 
decrease the weight of the genes in $S$ that have non-zero scores.

\begin{equation}
   N_R=\sum_{g_j\in S}|r_j|^p+min(r_j | r_j > 0)*\sum_{g_j\in S}I_{r_j=0}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
     $r_j$: score of gene $j$ in $L_{tar}$; $p=1$ 
\end{center}

\vspace{0.3cm}

The reason for this modification is that if only one gene in gene set $S$ has 
a non-zero score and this gene ranks high in $L_{tar}$, the weight of this gene 
will be 1 resulting in an $ES(S)$ close to 1. Thus, the original GSEA method 
will score the gene set $S$ as significantly enriched. However, this is 
undesirable because in this example only one gene is shared among the target 
set and the gene set $S$. Therefore, giving small weights to genes in $S$ that
have zero scores could decrease the weight of the genes in $S$ that have 
non-zero scores, thereby decrease the false positive rate. To favor truly 
enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways (gene set $S$) at the top of $L_{tar}$, 
the largest value of $P_{hit}-P_{miss}$ is set as $ES$. 

Subset top 10 ranking drugs in GESS result as query, mGSEA method internally 
gets their target set and transforms it to a scored ranked target list as query.
The scores represent weights of targets in the target set.
```{r tsea_mgsea, eval=TRUE}
# GO annotation system
mgsea_res <- tsea_mGSEA(drugs=drugs, type="GO", ont="MF", exponent=1, 
                        nPerm=1000, pvalueCutoff=1, minGSSize=5)
result(mgsea_res)
# KEGG annotation system
mgsea_k_res <- tsea_mGSEA(drugs=drugs, type="KEGG", exponent=1, 
                          nPerm=1000, pvalueCutoff=1, minGSSize=2)
result(mgsea_k_res)
```

### mabs method for TSEA

The input for the *mabs* method is $L_{tar}$, the same as for 
*m\_GSEA*. The *meanAbs* statistic ($mabs(S)$) of a gene set $S$ is 
calculated as mean absolute scores of the genes in $S$. In order to adjust for 
size variations in gene set $S$, 1000 random permutations of $L_{tar}$ are 
performed to determine $mabs(S,\pi)$. Subsequently, $mabs(S)$ is normalized by 
subtracting the median of the $mabs(S,\pi)$ and then dividing by the standard 
deviation of $mabs(S,\pi)$ yielding the normalized scores $Nmabs(S)$. Finally, 
the portion of $mabs(S,\pi)$ that is greater than $mabs(S)$ is used as nominal 
p value. The resulting nominal p values are adjusted for multiple hypothesis 
testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [@Fang2012-ms].

Subset top 10 ranking drugs in GESS result as query, mabs method internally 
get their target set and $L_{tar}$, which represents weights of targets. 
```{r tsea_mabs, eval=TRUE}
# GO annotation system
mabs_res <- tsea_mabs(drugs=drugs, type="GO", ont="MF", nPerm=1000, 
                      pvalueCutoff=0.05, minGSSize=5)
result(mabs_res)
# KEGG annotation system
mabs_k_res <- tsea_mabs(drugs=drugs, type="KEGG", nPerm=1000, 
                        pvalueCutoff=0.05, minGSSize=5)
result(mabs_k_res)
```

## DSEA

TSEA performs the FEA on target sets obtained by converting the drug sets from 
GESS results to the corresponding target sets given by known drug-target 
associations. Alternatively, one can use the drug sets for functional 
enrichment testing  directly by changing the mappings in the reference database 
from target-to-functional category mappings to drug-to-functional category 
mappings. The latter can be generated based on the drug-target information 
provided by DrugBank or related databases. As a result, one can perform the FEA 
on ranked drug lists directly. This so called Drug Set Enrichment Analysis 
(DSEA) approach has the advantage that the drugs in the query test sets are 
usually unique allowing to use them without any changes for functional 
enrichment methods. In contrast to this, the target query sets of the TSEA 
approach are not unique. Thus, they cannot be used without major changes 
(*e.g.* frequency weighting) with most existing functional enrichment 
methods where uniqueness in the test sets is one of the main assumptions. 
In case of DSEA, however, classical enrichment methods such as the 
hypergeometric test (*hyperG*) and GSEA can be used without any 
modifications. When DSEA is used with the hypergeometric test, the query is 
usually composed of the top ranking drugs from a GESS result, while it is 
ranked lists of all drugs in the reference database when GSEA is used. The 
similarity scores of the corresponding GESS method can be used for ranking the 
drugs as it is required by the GSEA algorithm. 
The drugs in the GESS results with zero scores are excluded.

### hyperG method for DSEA

Subset top 10 ranking drugs in GESS result as query for 
hypergeometric test for DSEA.
```{r dsea_hyperG, eval=TRUE}
drugs <- unique(result(lincs)$pert[1:10])
# GO annotation system
hyperG_res <- dsea_hyperG(drugs = drugs, type = "GO", ont="MF")
result(hyperG_res)
# KEGG annotation system
hyperG_k_res <- dsea_hyperG(drugs = drugs, type = "KEGG", 
                            pvalueCutoff = 1, qvalueCutoff = 1, 
                            minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 2000)
result(hyperG_k_res)
```

### GSEA method for DSEA

Use ranked drug list in GESS result as GSEA input, the scores are similarity 
metrics of the corresponding GESS methods. Drugs with zero scores are removed.
```{r dsea_gsea, eval=TRUE}
dl <- abs(result(lincs)$NCS); names(dl) <- result(lincs)$pert
dl <- dl[dl>0]
dl <- dl[!duplicated(names(dl))]
# GO annotation system
gsea_res <- dsea_GSEA(drugList=dl, type="GO", ont="MF", exponent=1, nPerm=1000,
                      pvalueCutoff=0.2, minGSSize=5)
result(gsea_res)
# KEGG annotation system
gsea_k_res <- dsea_GSEA(drugList=dl, type="KEGG", exponent=1, nPerm=1000, 
                        pvalueCutoff=0.5, minGSSize=5)
result(gsea_k_res)
```

## Consistency Comparison of enrichment results from 5 FEA methods

The enriched GO/KEGG categories were re-ranked by putting the terms supported 
by more methods to topper. For terms supported by the same number of methods, 
the lower of the mean ranks of the terms across enrichment methods, 
the topper of the terms. 

```{r cmp_enrich, eval=TRUE, fig.width=10.5, fig.height=5.5}
comp_fea_res(dup_hyperG_res, mgsea_res, mabs_res, hyperG_res, gsea_res, 
             Ntop=20, type="GO")
```

```{r cmp_enrich_k, eval=TRUE, fig.width=8}
comp_fea_res(dup_hyperG_k_res, mgsea_k_res, mabs_k_res, hyperG_k_res, 
             gsea_k_res, Ntop=20, type="KEGG")
```

## Conclusion

The consistency of the enriched GO terms/KEGG pathways from the five functional 
enrichment methods is pretty good. All of them could discovery the histone 
deacetylase pathways that the query drug vorinostat is involved in. Since each 
method have their advantages and disadvantages, it is reasonable to combine and 
re-rank their enrichment results to increase confidence.

# Visulization

A drug-target interaction network can be built if a drug set and a 
target/protein set is provided. If the target set is a GO category or a KEGG 
pathway, their term ID could be directly used.
